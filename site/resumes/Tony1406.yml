      details: |
        First I was interested in human behaviour and mental processes, I enjoy those years, and I learn a lot, but, I realized, that Psychology wasn't for me. I dimited from Psychology Carrer in the middle of my four year to seek another posibility that I considered multiples times before, beeing a Web Developer.
